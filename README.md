# VTuber-Styled-Logos
A compiled VTuber styled logos by mkpoli

## History
This is my part of a trend started in April 2024 originated ultimately by [this post in X by Aisu Asai](https://x.com/AisuAsai/status/1780118754590179702) for branding icons in VTuber styled kawaii logos, then followed by [this post by Aikoyori](https://x.com/Aikoyori/status/1780709418189078954) for VSCode, then accelerated by [さわらつき (sawaratsuki)](https://x.com/sawaratsuki1004/status/1781693841768427658) for other programming related technologies and companies. I took part in April 21st and made [a Svelte logo](https://x.com/mkpoli/status/1781931713939288337) but due to the busyness I was suffering I couldn't make more soon. I'm planning to make more when I become more free though.

## Usage
I release the logos made by me on CC0, which means it is basically release to public domain without any restrictions. You can use it, modify it, sell it, or do whatever you want without my permission or attribution for my part, however since those logos and names themselves are properties possessed by the official party, so be careful not to infringe copyright or right of service mark when using it.
